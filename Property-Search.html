                        <h5>Background</h5>
                        <p>Nexus recently entered the real estate sector with a goal of offering innovative solutions
                            to its clients. However, during a recent review of their property search, it became
                            apparent that while it provided robust market research and property analysis features, it
                            lacked integrated prospecting tools and defaulted filters, leading to a somewhat
                            overwhelming user experience. This case study outlines the process of enhancing Nexus'
                            property search to include prospecting tools alongside improved default filters, aiming to
                            streamline the user experience and provide comprehensive support for real estate
                            professionals.</p>

                        <h5>Identifying Challenges</h5>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Lack of Prospect Tools </strong> Nexus' property search primarily focuses on
                                market research and property analysis, neglecting the crucial aspect of prospecting.
                                Real estate professionals rely on prospecting to identify potential leads and convert
                                them into clients.</li>
                            <li><strong>Overwhelming Interface</strong> The absence of default filters leads to an
                                overwhelming user experience. Users are bombarded with vast amounts of data, making it
                                challenging to narrow down their search parameters effectively.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Approach</h5>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Research and Analysis</strong> Conduct in-depth market research and user
                                interviews to understand the specific prospecting needs of real estate professionals.
                                Identify common pain points and preferences regarding prospecting tools.</li>

                            <li><strong>Integration of Prospect Tools</strong> Collaborate with software developers to
                                integrate prospecting tools seamlessly into Nexus' property search.</li>

                            <li><strong>Refinement of Default Filters</strong> Analyse user behaviour and preferences to
                                determine the most commonly used search parameters. Implement default filters based on
                                this analysis to simplify the search process and improve user experience.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Implementation</h5>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Prospecting Tools Integration</strong> Extend the property search to allow lead
                                generation. Enable users to identify potential leads based on specific criteria such as
                                last sale and listing details, location, property type, and budget. Showcase result on
                                the platform include summary statistics and data visualisation to aid in agents
                                understanding of current market trends</li>
                            <li><strong>Default Filters Enhancement</strong> Implement default filters based on user
                                feedback and data analysis. These filters should cover essential search parameters such
                                as property type, location, price range, and amenities. Users can further customise
                                their search criteria as needed.</li>
                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Outcome</h5>
                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong> The integration of prospecting tools and
                                default filters significantly enhances the user experience of Nexus' property search.
                                Real estate professionals can now efficiently identify potential leads within
                                a streamlined interface.</li>
                            <li><strong>Increased Efficiency</strong> With access to comprehensive prospecting tools,
                                real estate professionals can save time and effort in the lead generation process.</li>
                            <li><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong> By offering a comprehensive property search
                                platform that addresses the prospecting needs of real estate professionals, Nexus gains
                                a competitive edge in the market. Clients are more likely to choose Nexus for their real
                                estate needs due to the platform's effectiveness and user-friendly interface.</li>

                        </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
                        <p>By recognizing the importance of prospecting alongside market research and property analysis,
                            Nexus will successfully enhance its property search to meet the evolving needs of real
                            estate professionals. The integration of prospecting tools and default filters will not only
                            improve the user experience but also enhances efficiency and competitiveness in the market.
                        </p>

                        <h5>My Learnings</h5>
                        <p>If I were to revisit this project, I would streamline the focus solely on enhancing
                            prospecting tools within the property search functionality, without expanding the scope to
                            include default filter improvements. The decision to narrow the scope arises from the
                            recognition that expanding the project's scope too broadly can overwhelm the tech team and
                            potentially compromise the quality and timeliness of deliverables. By concentrating efforts
                            on improving prospecting tools, we can maintain a clear and manageable objective, allowing
                            for more focused research, development, and implementation. This approach ensures that the
                            project remains feasible within the constraints of available resources and expertise,
                            ultimately maximising the likelihood of success while minimising undue strain on the tech
                            team.</p>
