                        <h5>Identifying Challenges</h5>
                        <p>
                            Nexus recognized the need to streamline the CMA process, aiming to enhance user
                            experience for real estate agents and their clients. They sought to integrate a digital
                            solution into the Nexus Web Platform that would automate the generation of CMA reports in
                            PDF format. The challenge lay in creating a seamless experience that matched the platform's
                            existing interface and functionality while maintaining brand consistency.

                        <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>User-Centric Design</strong> Reviewed extensive user research to understand the
                                preferences and pain points of real
                                estate agents and clients regarding CMAs. Identified key design elements and
                                functionalities
                                to enhance usability and
                                effectiveness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Platform Analysis</strong> Analysed the design language and interface components
                                of the Nexus Web Platform to ensure
                                alignment with the CMA template. Identified opportunities for integration and
                                customisation to create a cohesive user
                                experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Iterative Prototyping</strong> Developed wireframes and prototypes of the CMA
                                template, iterating based on feedback from
                                industry leading agents. Prioritised usability and readability in the design process,
                                refining layout and styling to
                                optimise the user experience.</li>
                            <li><strong>Branding Integration</strong> Incorporated Nexus's branding elements, including
                                logo placement, colour scheme, and
                                typography, to reinforce brand identity within the CMA template. Ensured that the
                                template remained consistent with
                                other Nexus communications to enhance brand recognition.</li>
                            <li><strong>Development and Integration</strong> Collaborated with developers to implement

                                existing features and workflows, conducting thorough testing to identify and address any
                                compatibility issues.</li>
                            <li> <strong>Feedback and Iteration</strong> Solicited feedback from agents following the
                                rollout of the CMA template. Implemented iterative improvements based on user
                                suggestions and usage data analysis, continuously refining the template to meet evolving
                                needs.</li>

                        <p>
                            By creating a unified CMA template aligned with the Nexus Web Platform, Nexus has

                            identity across all touchpoints.The collaborative approach to design and development ensured
                            that the template met the diverse needs of users while seamlessly integrating with existing
                            platform features. Moving forward, Nexus remains committed to iterating on the CMA
                            template to continually improve usability and functionality in response to user feedback and

                        <h5>My Learnings</h5>
                        <p>Reflecting on my experience with the project to create a unified CMA template aligned with
                            the Nexus Web Platform, I've recognized valuable insights for future endeavours. One key
                            learning is the importance of optimising workflow efficiency, particularly in the final
                            design stage. If I were to redo this project, I would opt to create the final designs
                            directly in InDesign, rather than Figma. This decision would have saved valuable time for
                            the team, as they wouldn't need to recreate the template in InDesign to incorporate form
                            fields. By streamlining the design process and eliminating unnecessary steps, we could have
                            allocated more time and resources to other critical aspects of the project, ultimately
                            enhancing productivity and accelerating project delivery. This experience highlights the
                            significance of leveraging tools and workflows that maximise efficiency and minimise
                            unnecessary complexities in project execution.</p>
