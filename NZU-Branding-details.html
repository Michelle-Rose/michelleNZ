            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>During my tenure at NZU, I identified an untapped opportunity to enhance the uniform hub pages for
              schools and clubs by offering customisation options aligning with their brand identities. This case study
              outlines the journey from identifying the opportunity to its successful implementation, leveraging my
              expertise in HTML and CSS.
            </p>
            <h5>Identifying the Opportunity</h5>
            <p>Upon recognizing the growing demand for personalised branding among schools and clubs, I proposed the
              idea
              of offering customisation options for the uniform hub pages to management. Recognizing its potential
              value, management greenlit the initiative, paving the way for collaboration with clients to revamp their
              digital presence.
            </p>


          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 portfolio-info">
            <h5>Collaborative Approach</h5>
            <p>Working closely with clients, I delved into understanding their unique brand identities, encompassing
              elements such as logos, colours, and typography. Through collaborative discussions and feedback loops, we
              delineated the vision for the revamped uniform hub pages, ensuring alignment with client expectations and
              brand guidelines.
            </p>
            <h5>Utilising HTML and CSS Expertise</h5>
            <p>
              Drawing upon my proficiency in HTML and CSS, I embarked on the technical implementation phase, translating
              design concepts into functional and visually appealing web pages. This involved customising the layout,
              styling elements, and integrating dynamic features to accommodate client-specific branding requirements.
            </p>

            <h5>Results and Impact</h5>
            <p>
              The introduction of customizable uniform hub pages yielded tangible results, including:
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Enhanced Brand Representation</strong> Clients witnessed a significant uplift in brand
                representation and visibility across digital platforms, fostering brand loyalty and recognition.</li>
              <li> <strong>Increased User Engagement </strong> The revamped uniform hub pages garnered heightened user
                engagement, driven by personalised branding options and intuitive user experience.</li>
              <li> <strong>Client Satisfaction</strong> Clients expressed overwhelming satisfaction with the customised
                solutions,citing their seamless integration with existing brand identities and marketing strategies.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>By seizing the opportunity to offer customisation options for uniform hub pages and leveraging my
              expertise in HTML and CSS, I facilitated the seamless integration of client brand identities into digital
              platforms. This case study underscores the transformative impact of customisation in elevating brand
              presence and fostering meaningful connections with stakeholders.</p>

            <h5>My Learning</h5>
            <p>If I was to do this project again I would integrate design tokens that would enhance consistency,
              scalability, flexibility, efficiency, accessibility, and collaboration. By establishing a standardised set
              of design properties such as colours, typography, and spacing, design tokens ensure consistency across
              each hub, streamline workflows between marketing, designers and developers, and allow for greater
              adaptability to evolving brand needs and market trends.
